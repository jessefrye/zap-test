# A simple plan that performs a baseline scan against a URL in the ZAP_TARGET env var.
# It uses the standard spider but only runs the AJAX spider if the app appears to be modern.
# The 2 spider tests will fail as they do not find at least 100 URLs, 
# but they do not fail the whole plan as they just report at INFO level.
